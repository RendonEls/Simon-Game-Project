# Simon-Game-Project

Description
 This project is a recreation of the game Simon, where the computer generates a random assortment of colors and indicates them on screen one at a time.  The player must match that specific sequence of colors by clicking the circles.  If the player matches the sequence, the level progresses and more colors are added at random.

Getting Started:

User clicks on "Start Game" and that point the computer generates a random assortment of colors. The user matches the random array by clicking on the colors in order. If they get the array right, an alert box will pop up saying "Great Job, click try again then next level." if they get the array wrong an alert box will appear saying "Wrong, click try again to start over."
